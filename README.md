<h1>Etape-du-Tour</h1>


<h2>Scenario</h2>
A friend of mine is a bicycle enthusiast. He is planning a trip to France to compete in Etape-du-Tour in July of this year. Etape-du-Tour allows amateur cyclists to experience riding a stage of the Tour de France route under similar conditions to professional cyclists.It takes place on a mountainous stage of the Tour de France route each year. I thought it would be a great opportunity for me to use Jupyter Notebook to practice writing Python code. I want to create scripts to assist him in preparing for and during his trip. 
<br />

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b>(Jupyter Notebook)

<h2>Task 1</h2>
  
I developed Python program that shows the current time in France so he get used to the local time in France, prior to his travel. Note EST is 6 hours behind France.</h4>
