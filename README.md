<h1>Etape-du-Tour</h1>


<h2>Scenario</h2>
A friend of mine is a bicycle enthusiast. He is planning a trip to France to compete in Etape-du-Tour in July of this year. Etape-du-Tour allows amateur cyclists to experience riding a stage of the Tour de France route under similar conditions to professional cyclists.It takes place on a mountainous stage of the Tour de France route each year. I thought it would be a great opportunity for me to use Jupyter Notebook to practice writing Python code. I want to create scripts to assist him in preparing for and during his trip. 
<br />

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b>(Jupyter Notebook)

<h2>Task 1</h2>
  
I developed Python program that shows the current time in France so he get used to the local time in France, prior to his travel. Note EST is 6 hours behind France.</h4>

<h2>Task 2</h2>
My friend wants to carry 500 Euros, which he wants to get from currency exchange kiosks at the airport. There is a 1.75% service charge for the currency exchange. He wants to know how many dollars he will need to spend to get 500 Euros, including the 1.75% service charge. Note:assume 1.1 Dollar = 1 Euro.</h4>

The script calculates the total amount of US dollars based on an initial amount of euros, taking into account both the currency conversion rate and associated fee for the exchange service.
